1. Grid Size:
Allow specifying a customizable grid size of n * n, with a default size of 100 * 100.

2. Mars Rover Deployment:
Support deploying multiple Mars Rovers on the grid.
Assign a unique identifier, starting position (x, y), and direction for each rover.

3. Instructions:
Allow teams to input strategies for their rovers.
Strategies can include move commands (M), rotate left (L), and rotate right (R).
Teams provide instructions for each rover, specifying the command order.

4. Execution:
Execute the provided instructions for each team's rovers.
Rovers follow the instructions in order, updating positions and directions accordingly.
Handle collisions if multiple rovers try to move to the same grid square.

5. Hidden Object Competition:
Introduce a hidden object or target within the grid.
Randomly determine the target's position within the grid boundaries.
Objective: Rovers should find the hidden object as quickly as possible.

6. Team Strategies:
Allow teams to develop their own strategies to position rovers and find the hidden object.
Strategies can be predefined and inputted at the start of each round.

7. Scorekeeping:
Track scores for each team based on rover performance in finding the hidden object.
Calculate scores considering factors such as time taken and efficiency of rover movements.
Display and update scores throughout the competition.
